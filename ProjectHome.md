MMLc is a GWT generator that processes files written in an enriched HTML like syntax and outputs code that instantiates the precise widgets to represent that code.

MMLc improves collaboration between programmer and designers in GWT projects, bringing back to the designers control over UI and style. Programmers need only to worry with programmers's stuff, which is a Good Thing.
